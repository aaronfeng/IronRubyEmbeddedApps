IronRubyEmbeddedApps
====================

This repository shows how to create 'standalone' .Net applications written in Ruby. You
can package up Ruby applications as ordinary .Net executables without having to ship a 
collection of plain-text Ruby source file. No-one need ever know....

This is done by using the following components:

# IronRuby
# Serfs
# IREmbeddedApp

IronRuby
--------
This is the Open Source version of Ruby for .Net

Serfs
-----
Serfs is a "Simple Embedded Resource File System" for .Net. It provides
access to files embedded in .Net assemblies.

IREmbeddedApp
-------------
This provides a wrapper for IronRuby and Serfs, and a bootstrapper that
modifies the Ruby load and require functions so that they can read files
from embedded resources instead of reading them from disk.

Contents
--------
This repository contains 3 projects:

IREmbeddedApp : The core IREmbeddedApp dll.

IRTestResources : An example DLL containing no code, just embedded resources 
(optparse, test::unit and flexmock taken directly from an ordinary Ruby install).

ExampleApps : An example command-line program showing how to run Ruby programs.

Example:

try {
  EmbeddedRuby er1 = new EmbeddedRuby();
  er1.Mount("Applications");
  exitcode = er1.Run("bottles.rb");
} catch (Exception e) {
  Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
